* Music is the other half of my life. I learned the piano for six years in elementary school, and I am now learning the violin in Madison. And the following are some of my favarite clips.
  * [Zigeunerweisen, Op. 20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmV2hj-I7Xo) 
  * [Debussy: Clair de lune](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujW4YvUWA9w) 
  * [Main Theme - Detective Conan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVRDKRlIcOc), this piece comes from a Japanese anime "Detective Conan", which is one of my favarite detectives.
  * [Sherlock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6B-8V4LyaU) is another favorite detective.
  * [Hedwig's Theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ki8hN7AWsZ4), even though I am a science student, I do believe there is magic in this world.

* I also like movies and musicals. My favorites are the Avengers and Hamilton.
